## Instructions

To load this game open the index.html file in your browser. 

The goal of the game is to have the player reach the top of the board without colliding into any of the bugs. The player can move left, right, up and down using the directional keys on your keyboard. If the player collides with a bug then the game is reset. The game is over when the player reaches the water. Then a modal will appear confirming that you won the game and allowing you to restart the game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
